# ER-1 VST Plug-in
This repository will build a VST Plug-in that replicates the classic Korg ER-1
drum machine.

### To Build
This is a MUDS-formatted project, so as long as the required system libraries
are present, and this repository was cloned using `git clone --recursive` then
a build can be started from the root directory using one of the scripts in the
`scripts` folder.
